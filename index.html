        <h1 class="main-title">Welcome to JU Physiotherapy</h1>


        <div class="main-bio">

                alt="My name is James Underwood and I offer professional, mobile physiotherapy services in the Woburn, Milton Keynes, Leighton Buzzard, Woburn Sands, Newport Pagnell and surrounding villages of Bedfordshire UK. I specialise in back pain, elderly mobility and balance issues, massage manipulation, rehabilitation, sport injuries and joint pain.">

            <p>Iâ€™m James and I am a fully-qualified musculoskeletal (MSK) physiotherapist, living in Woburn,
                Bedfordshire. I
                founded JU Physiotherapy with the aim of providing affordable, quality, personalised care to help those
                struggling with pain, mobility and balance issues
            </p>
            <p>I graduated with a first-class Bachelor of Science honours degree in Physiotherapy at Oxford Brookes
                University in 2014 and I am registered with the <a style="text-decoration:none;"
                    href="https://www.hcpc-uk.org/">Health Care Professions Council (HCPC)</a> and the <a
                    style="text-decoration:none;" href="https://www.csp.org.uk/">Chartered
                    Society of Physiotherapy (CSP)</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Since qualifying as a physiotherapist nearly a decade ago, I have worked in Primary and Secondary MSK
                healthcare services in the NHS, at Milton Keynes University Hospital, Bedford Hospital and later, in GP
                surgeries. I also have experience of working in amateur sports, having worked as a sports
                physiotherapist for Buckingham Rugby Club for 3 years.
            </p>
            <p>This training and work experience has involved working with patients from a variety of backgrounds,
                including sport injuries, post-operative joint replacements and surgeries, rheumatology patients,
                patients suffering with chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia, and elderly patients with balance
                issues.
