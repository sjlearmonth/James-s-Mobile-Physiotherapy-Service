        My name is James and I am a fully-qualified musculo-skeletal (MSK)
        physiotherapist and I live in Woburn, Bedfordshire. I graduated with a first class Bachelor of Science honours
        degree in
        Physiotherapy at Oxford Brookes University, Oxford in 2014.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="training-content">Since qualifying as a physiotherapist, I have worked in Primary and Secondary
        musculo-skeletal healthcare
        services at Milton Keynes University Hospital and later at a GP's surgery. I have also worked as a sports
        physiotherapist at Buckingham Rugby Club for 3 years. I am also registered with the Health Care Professions
        Council (HCPC) and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class="training-content">This training and work experience has involved me working with patients from a variety
        of
        backgrounds including sport injuries, post-operative joint replacements and surgeries, rheumatology
        patients, patients suffering with chronic pain conditions, such as fibromyalgia, and elderly patients with
        balance
        issues.

        <p>
            <em>"Saw James with a long standing issue with my wrist. He was great. Very patient as the issue comes and
                goes and was tricky to get to the bottom of. A very thorough assessment and knowledgeable. A great bed
                side manner too! Would definitely recommend him."</em>
